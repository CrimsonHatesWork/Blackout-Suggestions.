# Blackout-Suggestions.
A repository for my blackout Suggestions because discord isnt generous to provide more than 2k letters to rant.



Suggestion #1 


-# i², that 14 day mute was tragic, thanks for that.

Across multiple updates and community cycles, this exact suggestion has been posted repeatedly by several players. Not once, not twice, not even thrice, but four separate times, each asking for the same clarification. Below are the previous posts for reference:

Despite four reposts and countless comments, there has still been no detailed developer feedback on why commander drones cannot be stored, placed, turned off, or reworked. There has been no explanation about technical limits, balance intentions, performance concerns, or even simple design goals. Just silence or meme comments that bury the topic instead of helping testers understand the system.

Why this matters

Commander kits are meant to feel authoritative. They are supposed to make a player feel like they are leading, planning, and coordinating. The current drone behavior does the opposite. The moment you equip a commander kit, the drone turns you into a beacon for anyone who wants to hunt you. High level players often take advantage of this and track commanders down without effort. This ruins the intended fantasy of the role and discourages players from even using commander kits.

The community has repeatedly brought this up, but every time the suggestion appears, the discussion gets drowned out by people mocking it instead of discussing it. When testers make long, thoughtful posts and get no real developer reasoning in return, frustration and distrust naturally grow.

Main Point

Players who paid for early access expect clear feedback on repeated suggestions. A suggestion posted four times with no meaningful response shows a communication gap. It is not about demanding dev time for every tiny idea. It is about getting at least some explanation when the same suggestion keeps resurfacing.

Even a short answer stating the reasoning behind the current mechanic would solve most of the frustration. The community wants clarity, not silence. A response that actually explains the decision would help everyone understand the design vision.

Secondary Point: Why can’t commander drones be stored or placed

The most common question is why commander drones cannot be folded, stored, put in a backpack, placed inside a building, or temporarily deactivated. **The game already includes highly advanced technology like photonic marker teleportation for Blade Dancer and similar tools that bend space or long distance movement.** In that context, it feels strange that something as basic as a small drone cannot stay with the commander or be handheld for travel.

If this is a balance decision, a lore restriction, a performance limitation, or a technical constraint, then the community deserves a clear explanation. Right now, the design feels inconsistent and players are confused about what the intended behavior actually is.

**What we are asking for**

1) A clear explanation of why the current drone behavior exists

2) Details on whether storage, deactivation, or alternate deployment is possible

3) Technical or balance reasons if these options are not viable

4) Acknowledgement that this suggestion has been posted four times without proper feedback

5) Respectful and informative replies instead of dismissive jokes


**Additional Clarification**

This suggestion is not an attack on the team. Testers appreciate the effort put into making this game. The frustration comes from the lack of structured feedback when players try to engage seriously. Even if the answer is simply that drone storage will not happen, the community needs to know the reason so the topic can finally settle.

A simple explanation like it creates performance issues, or it breaks certain systems, or it creates unavoidable exploits, or it contradicts the intended gameplay structure would immediately clear up confusion.

**Closing Statement**

As early access players who help test the game, we are asking for a complete and direct explanation regarding commander drone storage and behavior. Even if the final answer is that this feature will not be added, having the reasoning laid out would finally close the loop after four separate posts on the same topic.

**Please reply respectfully. The community understands limited staff and time zone issues, but we still need proper explanations for repeated, high effort suggestions.**

-# yes ai was used because I couldn't follow guidelines so I pasted my original 1000 letter into gpt for it to fix up. i², I still hate you.
